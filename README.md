Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.
pip or pipenv for managing dependencies.
(Optional) Virtual environment tool such as venv or virtualenv.
## Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

cd your-repo-name

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

#### Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
#### Apply migrations:

#### Usage
Running the Development Server:
python manage.py runserver
#### Access the API:
Open your browser or API client (like Postman) and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/info/ to see the basic information endpoint in action.

#### Interacting with the API:
Use tools like Postman or curl to test different endpoints and methods.
### Testing
Run Tests:
Ensure you have written tests for your endpoints. You can run the tests with:
python manage.py test
#### Coverage:
For test coverage, consider using coverage.py:
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
#### Deployment
Production Settings:
Make sure to adjust your settings.py for production (e.g., DEBUG=False, allowed hosts, etc.).
### Hosting:
You can deploy this project on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. Check the official Django deployment checklist for best practices.
### Future Enhancements
 Authentication and Authorization:
Add token-based authentication to secure sensitive endpoints.
#### Pagination and Filtering:
Implement pagination and filtering for endpoints that return lists of items.
#### API Documentation:
Integrate API documentation tools such as Swagger or DRF Spectacular for better API discoverability.
#### Rate Limiting:
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
